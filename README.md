# melange-examples

A repository of demo projects using
[Melange](https://github.com/melange-re/melange) and
[opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/).

If you are looking for a template with esy, check
[melange-esy-template](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-esy-template).

## Examples

Each example is a self-contained, complete project with its README, a Makefile
and an opam file to define the dependencies.

To use any of the examples, clone this repository, and then just replace the
contents with the folder of the example you want to use to get started.

Then follow the example `README.md` instructions to get started.

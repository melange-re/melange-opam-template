; `melange.emit` is a Dune stanza that will produce build rules to generate
; JavaScript files from sources using the Melange compiler

(melange.emit

 ; The `target` field is used by Dune to put all JavaScript artifacts in a specific folder inside `_build/default`
 ; This field `target` allows to have multiple `melange.emit` stanzas in the `dune` file
 ; if, for example, we want to produce ES6 and CommonJS output from the same sources.
 (target output)

 ; The `alias` field can be used later on to build just the artifacts from this `melange.emit`
 ; by calling `dune build @react`.
 ; Note that if no `alias` field is defined, a default `melange` alias will be used instead.
 (alias react)

 ; Here's the list of dependencies of the stanza. In this case (being `melange.emit`),
 ; Dune will look into those dependencies and generate rules with JavaScript targets
 ; for the modules in those libraries as well.
 ; Caveat: the libraries need to be specified with `(modes melange)`.
 (libraries reason-react world melange.belt)

 ; By default, Dune will include all modules in the folder to the targets. With `modules` field
 ; we can tweak this default behavior by excluding `hello` from the list of targets of this stanza.
 ; See https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/predicate-language.html#predicate-language
